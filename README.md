# LibraryGame
Library is a game I am working on to take some of the best stuff I love from other sources, such as how the American TV show "The Librarians" uses magic in a 3 part system (Power to change reality, focus to direct the change, and the effect in the world). Library is also going to have a gui and keyboard controls similar to Minecraft and I am going to add features to my game that I feel is lacking in Minecraft (Not that Minecraft is bad, it is a great game, however there are features I wish existed in vanilla so I would not need to mod to get them). An example of that is how the Replay Mod exists for Minecraft. It allows me to record the gameplay and replay it as if I traveled in Time to watch the game again as if I was actually there.
