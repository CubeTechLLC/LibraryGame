# LibraryGame
This game will more than likely not be started on until the operating system (IceCube) gets to a usable point. This is a game based off of the magic of the American TV Show "The Librarians" and is more than likely going to be similar to both Minecraft and Space Engineers. The intention is to make the game for IceCube, so it is reasonable to make the operating system first.
